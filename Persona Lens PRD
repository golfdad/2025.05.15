# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name: InsightLens – AI-Powered Open Data Intelligence Tool  
**Author**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: May 15, 2025

## 1. Purpose

**InsightLens** is a tool that enables users to input natural language queries and retrieve real-time, structured insights by searching across news, social media, and other open data sources. The tool will provide output in the form of **personas, brand profiles, sentiment analysis**, and **actionable insights**, tailored to marketers, analysts, founders, and strategy professionals.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Business and brand leaders struggle to synthesize real-time insights from fragmented public data sources (news, social, forums). Manual research is time-consuming and often incomplete. There is no accessible platform that leverages natural language input to automate this synthesis and generate analysis tailored to strategic needs (e.g., brand sentiment, emerging personas, competitor positioning).

---

## 3. Objectives and Goals

- Allow users to type queries in natural language (e.g., “What do people think about Oura vs Whoop in 2025?”).
- Retrieve and analyze data from multiple open sources (news, Reddit, Twitter/X, forums, blogs).
- Provide:
  - **Personas**: Behavioral and psychographic segments inferred from mentions.
  - **Brand & Product Sentiment**: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of brand perception.
  - **Narrative Clusters**: Trending topics and themes by audience segment.
  - **Actionable Insights**: Emerging needs, opportunities, or risks.
- Deliver results in an interactive, digestible interface.
